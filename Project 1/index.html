    <p><b>Quantum Teleportation:</b> <br>

        In science fiction, teleportation involves transmitting matter instantaneously from one location to another. While physically teleporting objects is not possible, teleportation is achievable in quantum mechanics for quantum information and states.
        <br>
        Quantum teleportation is a process by which the complete quantum state of a particle can be transferred to another distant particle. This occurs without the particles physically traveling between the sending and receiving locations. Rather, the transmission exploits the bizarre phenomenon of quantum entanglement between particles.
        <br>
        Entanglement involves creating a pair of particles that are correlated in their properties, regardless of the distance between them. When the state of one entangled particle is measured, the corresponding state of its entangled partner is instantly defined, even if separated by light years.
        <br>
        This effect enables teleportation. First, an entangled pair of particles is generated. One particle is given to a sender, Alice, and the other to a receiver, Bob. Alice has a third particle that is unknown to Bob and is in a particular quantum state that she wants to teleport to Bob.
        <br>
        By performing a joint measurement on her two particles, Alice destroys the state of her unknown particle. But that measurement results in Bob’s entangled particle acquiring the exact state of Alice’s original particle. The joint measurement transmits the quantum information to Bob through the entanglement link.
        <br>
        While no particles physically travel between Alice and Bob, the complete quantum state is transported from one place to another. This “disembodied” transfer of information is true teleportation on the quantum scale. Experiments have successfully demonstrated quantum teleportation over several kilometers. The technique holds prospects for enabling new means of transmitting uncrackable secret messages in quantum cryptography and quantum computing operations.
